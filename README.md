# JobRecommenderSystem
A simple job recommender system developed in Python which uses data visualization libraries such as numpy, pandas 
and Data Science/ML Libraries such as sklearn, matploilib. It also uses NLP and ML Algorithms. 
The dataset used is a file named "jobs.csv". 
It displays the job titles and the skills required for the same.
It uses  machine learning through which a model is trained to predict which jobs a user might be interested in based on their 
past job searches, resumes, and other relevant data. 
The library scikit-learn is used to train the model using this data, and then the model makes recommendations to the user.
Contributions are welcome :)
